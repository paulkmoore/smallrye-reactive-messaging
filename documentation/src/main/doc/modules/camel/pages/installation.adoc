== Using the camel connector

To you the camel Connector, add the following dependency to your project:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.smallrye.reactive</groupId>
  <artifactId>smallrye-reactive-messaging-camel</artifactId>
  <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

You will also need the dependency of the Camel component you are using.
For example, if you want to process files, you would need to add the Camel File Component artifact:

[source, xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-file</artifactId>
  <version>{camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

The connector name is: `smallrye-camel`.

So, to indicate that a channel is managed by this connector you need:

[source]
----
# Inbound
mp.messaging.incoming.[channel-name].connector=smallrye-camel

# Outbound
mp.messaging.outgoing.[channel-name].connector=smallrye-camel
----
