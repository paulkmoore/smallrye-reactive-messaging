== Using the Camel API

The Camel connector is based on the https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/reactive-streams-component.html[Reactive Streams support] from Camel.
If you have an application already using the Camel API (routes, `from`...), you can integrate it with Reactive Messaging.

=== Getting the CamelReactiveStreamsService

Once you add the Camel connector to your application, you can retrieve the `org.apache.camel.component.reactive.streams.api.CamelReactiveStreamsService` object:

[source,java, indent=0]
----
include::example$api/CamelApi.java[tag=reactive]
----

This `CamelReactiveStreamsService` lets you create `Publisher` and `Subscriber` instances from existing routes.

=== Using Camel Route with @Outgoing

If you have an existing Camel route, you can transform it as a `Publisher` using the `CamelReactiveStreamsService`.
Then, you can return this `Publisher` from a method annotated with `@Outgoing`:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$api/CamelApi.java[tag=source]
----

You can also use `RouteBuilder`:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$api/CamelApi.java[tag=source-route-builder]
----

== Using Camel Route with @Incoming

If you have an existing Camel route, you can transform it as a `Subscriber` using the `CamelReactiveStreamsService`.
Then, you can return this `Subscriber` from a method annotated with `@Incoming`:

[source, java]
----
include::example$api/CamelApi.java[tag=sink]
----

You can also use a producer:

[source,java]
----
include::example$api/CamelApi.java[tag=producer]
