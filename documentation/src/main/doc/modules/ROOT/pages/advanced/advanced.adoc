[#logging]
== Logging

The logging uses SLF4J, check the https://www.slf4j.org/[SLF4J web site] for further details.

[#strict]
== Strict Binding Mode

By default, SmallRye Reactive Messaging does not enforce whether all _mediators_ are connected. It just print a warning
message. The strict mode fails the deployment if some "incoming" are not connected to "outgoing". To enable this mode,
pass the `-Dsmallrye-messaging-strict-binding=true` to the command line.
