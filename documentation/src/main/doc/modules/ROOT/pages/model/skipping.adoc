== Skipping messages

Sometimes you receive a message and don't want to produce an output message.
To handle this, you have several choices:

1. for method processing single message or payload, producing `null` would produced an ignored message (not forwarded)
2. for method processing streams, you can generate an _empty_ stream.

The next snippet illustrates the first approach:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$skip/SingleSkip.java[tag=skip]
----

The second approach consists in emitted an _empty_ `Multi` (or `Publisher`):

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$skip/StreamSkip.java[tag=skip]
