== Creating Messages

Messages are envelopes around payload.
They are the vehicle.
While manipulating payload is convenient, messages let you add metadata, handle acknowledgement...

Creating `Messages` is done using the `Message` interface directly:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$messages/MessageExamples.java[tag=creation]
----

You can also create new instance of `Message` from an existing one:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$messages/MessageExamples.java[tag=copy]
----

[NOTE]
.Acknowledgement?
====

This will be covered in the xref:acknowledgement/acknowledgement.adoc[acknowledgement] section.

[NOTE]
.Connector Metadata
====
Most connectors are providing metadata to let you extract technical details about the message, but also customize the outbound dispatching.
