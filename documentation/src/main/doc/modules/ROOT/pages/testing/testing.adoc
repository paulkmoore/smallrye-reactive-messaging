= Testing without brokers

It's not rare to have to test your application but deploying the infrastructure can be cumbersome.
While Docker or Test Containers have improved the testing experience, you may want to _mock_ this infrastructure.

SmallRye Reactive Messaging proposes an _in-memory_ connector for this exact purpose.
It allows switching the connector used for a channel with an _in-memory_ connector.
This in-memory connector provides a way to send messages to incoming channels, or check the received messages for outgoing
channels.

To use the _in-memory_ connector, you need to add the following dependency to your project:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.smallrye.reactive</groupId>
  <artifactId>smallrye-reactive-messaging-in-memory</artifactId>
  <version>{project-version}</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

Then, in a test, you can do something like:

[source,java]
----
include::example$testing/MyTest.java[]
----

When switching a channel to the in-memory connector, all the configuration properties are ignored.
