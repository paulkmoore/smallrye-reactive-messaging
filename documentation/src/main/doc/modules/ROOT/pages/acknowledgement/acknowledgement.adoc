== Acknowledgement

Acknowledgment is an essential concept in messaging.
A message is acknowledged when its processing or reception has been successful.
It allows the broker to move to the next message.

How acknowledgment is used, and the exact behavior in terms of retry and resilience depends on the broker.
For example, for Kafka, it would commit the offset.
For AMQP, it would inform the broker that the message has been _accepted_.

Reactive Messaging supports acknowledgement.
The default acknowledgment depends on the method signature.
Also, the acknowledgment policy can be configured using the `@Acknowledgement` annotation.

=== Chain of acknowledgment

If we reuse this example:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$beans/Chain.java[tag=chain]
----

The framework automatically acknowledges the message received from the `sink` channel when the `consume` method returns.
As a consequence, the message received by the `process` method is acknowledged, and so on.
In other words, it creates a chain of acknowledgement - from the outbound channel to the inbound channel.

When using connectors to receive and consume messages, the outbound connector acknowledges the messages when they are dispatched successfully to the broker.
The acknowledgment chain would, as a result, acknowledges the inbound connector, which would be able to send an acknowledgment to the broker.

This chain of acknowledgment is automatically implemented when processing payloads.


=== Acknowledgment when using Messages

When using `Messages`, the user controls the acknowledgment, and so the chain is not formed automatically.
It gives you more flexibility about when and how the incoming messages are acknowledged.

If you create a `Message` using the `with` method, is copy the acknowledgment function from the incoming message:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$ack/MessageAckExamples.java[tag=with-payload]
----

To have more control over the acknowledgment, you can create a brand new `Message` and pass the acknowledgment function:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$ack/MessageAckExamples.java[tag=message-creation]
----

However, you may need to create the acknowledgment chain, to acknowledge the incoming message:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$ack/MessageAckExamples.java[tag=process]
----

To trigger the acknowledgment of the incoming message, use the `ack()` method.
It returns a `CompletionStage`, receiving `null` as value when the acknowledgment has completed.

=== Acknowledgment when using streams

When transforming streams of `Message`, the acknowledgment is delegated to the user.
It means that it's up to the user to acknowledged the incoming messages:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$ack/StreamAckExamples.java[tag=message]
----

In the previous example, we only generate a single message per incoming message so that we can use the `with` method.
It becomes more sophisticated when grouping incoming messages or when each incoming message produces multiple messages.

In the case of a stream of payloads, the default strategy acknowledges the incoming messages before being processed by the method (regardless of the outcome).

include::example$ack/StreamAckExamples.java[tag=payload]

=== Controlling acknowledgement

The {javadoc-base}/org/eclipse/microprofile/reactive/messaging/acknowledgment.html[`Acknowledgment`] annotation lets you customize the default strategy presented in the previous sections.
The `@Acknowledgement` annotation takes a _strategy_ as parameter.
Reactive Messaging proposed 4 strategies:

* `POST_PROCESSING` - the acknowledgement of the incoming message is executed once the produced message is acknowledged.
* `PRE_PROCESSING` - the acknowledgement of the incoming message is executed before the message is processed by the method.
* `MANUAL` - the acknowledgement is doe by the user.
* `NONE` - No acknowledgment is performed, neither manually or automatically.

It is recommended to use `POST_PROCESSING` as it guarantees that the full processing has completed before acknowledging the incoming message.
However, sometimes it's not possible, and this strategy is not available if you manipulate streams of `Messages` or payloads.

The `PRE_PROCESSING` strategy can be useful to acknowledge a message early in the process:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$ack/PreAckExamples.java[tag=pre]
----

It cuts the acknowledgment chain, meaning that the rest of the processing is not linked to the incoming message anymore.
This strategy is the default strategy when manipulating streams of payloads.

Refer to the xref:signatures/signatures.adoc[signature list] to determine which strategies are available for a specific method signature and what's the default strategy.

=== Negative acknowledgement

Messages can also be _nacked_, which indicates that the message was not processed correctly.
The `Message.nack` method indicates failing processing (and supply the reason), and, as for successful acknowledgment, the _nack_ is propagated through the chain of messages.

If the message has been produced by a connector, this connector implements specific behavior when receiving a _nack_.
It can fail (default), or ignore the failing, or implement a dead-letter queue mechanism.
Refer to the connector documentation for further details about the available strategies.

If the message is sent by an emitter using the `send(P)` method, the returned `CompletionStage` is completed _exceptionally_ with the _nack_ reason.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$ack/NackOnEmitter.java[tag=emitter]
----

Negative acknowledgment can be manual or automatic.
If your method handles instances of `Message` and the acknowledgment strategy is `MANUAL`, you can nack a message explicitly.
You must indicate the reason (an exception) when calling the `nack` method.
As for successful acknowledgment, the `nack` returns a `CompletionStage` completed when the `nack` has been processed.

If your method uses the `POST_PROCESSING` acknowledgment strategy, and the method fails (either by throwing an exception or by producing a failure), the message is automatically nacked with the caught exception:

[source, java, indent=0]

include::example$ack/AutoNack.java[tag=auto-nack]
