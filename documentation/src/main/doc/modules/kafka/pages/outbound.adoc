== Writing Kafka Records

The Kafka Connector can write Reactive Messaging `Messages` as Kafka Records.

=== Example

Let's imagine you have a Kafka broker running, and accessible using the `kafka:9092` address (by default it would use `localhost:9092`).
Configure your application to write the messages from the `prices` channel into a Kafka _topic_ as follows:

[source]
----
kafka.bootstrap.servers=kafka:9092      # <1>

mp.messaging.outgoing.prices.connector=smallrye-kafka   # <2>
mp.messaging.outgoing.prices.value.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.DoubleSerializer  # <3>
----
1. Configure the broker location. You can configure it globally or per channel
2. Configure the connector to manage the `prices` channel
3. Sets the (Kafka) serializer to encode the message payload into the record's value

NOTE: You don't need to set the Kafka topic. By default, it uses the channel name (`prices`). You can configure the `topic` attribute to override it.

Then, your application must send `Message<Double>` to the `prices` channel.
It can use `double` payloads as in the following snippet:

[source, java]
----
include::example$outbound/KafkaPriceProducer.java[]
----

Or, you can send `Message<Double>`:

[source, java]
----
include::example$outbound/KafkaPriceMessageProducer.java[]
----

=== Serialization

The serialization is handled by the underlying Kafka Client.
You need to configure the:

* `mp.messaging.outgoing.[channel-name].value.serializer` to configure the value serializer (mandatory)
* `mp.messaging.outgoing.[channel-name].key.serializer` to configure the key serializer (optional, default to `String`)

If you want to use a custom serializer, add it to your `CLASSPATH` and configure the associate attribute.

By default, the written record contains:

* the `Message` payload as _value_
* no key, or the key configured using the `key` attribute or the key passed in the metadata attached to the `Message`
* the timestamp computed for the system clock (`now`) or the timestamp passed in the metadata attached to the `Message`

=== Outbound Metadata

When sending `Messages`, you can add an instance of {javadoc-base}/apidocs/io/smallrye/reactive/messaging/kafka/OutgoingKafkaRecordMetadata.html[`OutgoingKafkaRecordMetadata`] to influence how the message is going to written to Kafka.
For example, you can configure the topic directly in the message, or add Kafka headers, configure the record key...

[source, java]
----
include::example$outbound/KafkaOutboundMetadataExample.java[tag=code]
----

=== Acknowledgement

Kafka acknowledgement can take times depending on the configuration.
Also it stores in-memory the records that cannot be written.

By default, the connector does not wait for Kafka to acknowledge the record and continue the processing (acknowledging the received `Message`).
You can disable this by setting the `waitForWriteCompletion` attribute to `false`.

Note the the `acks` attribute has a huge impact on the record acknowledgement.

You can also pass any property supported by the https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-kafka-client/java/[Vert.x Kafka client].
