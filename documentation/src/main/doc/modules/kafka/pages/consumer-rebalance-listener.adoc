=== Consumer Rebalance Listener

To handle offset commit and assigned partitions yourself, you can provide a consumer rebalance listener.
To achieve this, implement the `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.kafka.KafkaConsumerRebalanceListener` interface and exposed it as a `@Named` bean.
A usual use case is to store offset in a separate data store to implement exactly-once semantic, or starting the processing at a specific offset.

The listener is invoked every time the consumer topic/partition assignment changes.
For example, when the application starts, it invokes the `partitionsAssigned` callback with the initial set of topics/partitions associated with the consumer.
If, later, this set changes, it calls the `partitionsRevoked` and `partitionsAssigned` callbacks again, so you can implement custom logic.

Note that the rebalance listener methods are called from the Kafka _polling_ thread and must block the caller thread until completion.
That's because the rebalance protocol has synchronization barriers, and using asynchronous code in a rebalance listener may be executed after the synchronization barrier.

When topics/partitions are assigned or revoked from a consumer, it pauses the message delivery and restarts once the rebalance completes.

If the rebalance listener handles offset commit on behalf of the user (using the `ignore` commit strategy), the rebalance listener **must** commit the offset synchronously in the `partitionsRevoked` callback.
We also recommend applying the same logic when the application stops.

Unlike the `ConsumerRebalanceListener`  from Apache Kafka, the `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.kafka.KafkaConsumerRebalanceListener` methods pass the Kafka `Consumer` and the set of topics/partitions.

==== Example

In this example we set-up a consumer that always starts on messages from at most 10 minutes ago (of offset 0). First we need to provide
a bean managed implementation of `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.kafka.KafkaConsumerRebalanceListener` annotated with
`javax.inject.Named`. We then must configure our inbound connector to use this named bean.

[source, java]

include::example$inbound/KafkaRebalancedConsumerRebalanceListener.java[]
----

[source, java]
----
include::example$inbound/KafkaRebalancedConsumer.java[]
----

To configure the inbound connector to use the provided listener we either set the consumer rebalance listener's name:

* `mp.messaging.incoming.rebalanced-example.consumer-rebalance-listener.name=rebalanced-example.rebalancer`

Or have the listener's name be the same as the group id:

* `mp.messaging.incoming.rebalanced-example.group.id=rebalanced-example.rebalancer`

Setting the consumer re-balance listener's name takes precedence over using the group id.
