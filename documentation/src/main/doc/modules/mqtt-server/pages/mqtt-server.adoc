= MQTT Server

The MQTT Server connector starts an MQTT server and forwards messages sent from MQTT clients to your Reactive Messaging application.
The  MQTT Server connector is based on the https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-mqtt/java/#_vert_x_mqtt_server[Vert.x MQTT Server].

== Introduction

http://mqtt.org/[MQTT] is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol.
It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport.

Unlike the MQTT Connector, this connector starts an MQTT server and receives messages from connected clients.
These messages are routed to your Reactive Messaging application.

WARNING: This isn't a fully featured MQTT server, it will only handle publish requests and their
acknowledgment (for QoS 1 & 2). It will ignore subscription requests for instance.

NOTE: The server has no persistence, if no subscribers are listening, messages will be dropped.
