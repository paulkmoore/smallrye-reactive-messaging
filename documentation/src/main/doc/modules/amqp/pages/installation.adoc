== Using the AMQP connector

To use the AMQP Connector, add the following dependency to your project:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.smallrye.reactive</groupId>
  <artifactId>smallrye-reactive-messaging-amqp</artifactId>
  <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

The connector name is: `smallrye-amqp`.

So, to indicate that a channel is managed by this connector you need:

[source]
----
# Inbound
mp.messaging.incoming.[channel-name].connector=smallrye-amqp

# Outbound
mp.messaging.outgoing.[channel-name].connector=smallrye-amqp
