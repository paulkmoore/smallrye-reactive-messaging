== Receiving messages from AMQP

The AMQP connector lets you retrieve messages from an https://www.amqp.org/product/architecture[AMQP broker or router].
The AMQP connector retrieves _AMQP Messages_ and maps each of them into Reactive Messaging `Messages`.

=== Example

Let's imagine you have an AMQP broker (such as https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/[Apache ActiveMQ Artemis]) running, and accessible using the `amqp:5672` address (by default it would use `localhost:5672`).
Configure your application to receive AMQP Messages on the `prices` channel as follows:

[source]
----
amqp-host=amqp               # <1>
amqp-port=5672               # <2>
amqp-username=my-username    # <3>
amqp-password=my-password    # <4>

mp.messaging.incoming.prices.connector=smallrye-amqp  # <5>
----
1. Configures the broker/router host name. You can do it per channel (using the `host` attribute) or globally using `amqp-host`
2. Configures the broker/router port. You can do it per channel (using the `port` attribute) or globally using `amqp-port`. The default is `5672`.
3. Configures the broker/router username if required. You can do it per channel (using the `username` attribute) or globally using `amqp-username`.
4. Configures the broker/router password if required. You can do it per channel (using the `password` attribute) or globally using `amqp-password`.
5. Instructs the `prices` channel to be managed by the AMQP connector

NOTE: You don't need to set the AMQP _address_. By default, it uses the channel name (`prices`). You can configure the `address` attribute to override it.

Then, your application receives `Message<Double>`.
You can consumes the payload directly:

[source, java]
----
include::example$inbound/AmqpPriceConsumer.java[]
----

Or, you can retrieve the `Message<Double>`:

[source, java]
----
include::example$inbound/AmqpPriceMessageConsumer.java[]
----

=== Deserialization

The connector converts incoming AMQP Messages into Reactive Messaging `Message<T>` instances.
`T` depends on the _body_ of the received AMQP Message.

The http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-types-v1.0-os.html[AMQP Type System] defines the supported types.

[options="header"]
|===
| AMQP Body Type | `<T>`
| AMQP Value containing a http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-types-v1.0-os.html#section-primitive-type-definitions[AMQP Primitive Type] | the corresponding Java type
| AMQP Value using the `Binary` type | `byte[]`
| AMQP Sequence | `List`
| AMQP Data and the `content-type` is set to `application/json` | https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/core/json/JsonObject.html[`JsonObject`]
| AMQP Data with a different `content-type` | `byte[]`

=== Inbound Metadata

Messages coming from AMQP contains an instance of {javadoc-base}/io/smallrye/reactive/messaging/amqp/IncomingAmqpMetadata.html[`IncomingAmqpMetadata`] in the metadata.

[source, java]
----
include::example$inbound/AmqpMetadataExample.java[]
----

=== Acknowledgement

When a Reactive Messaging `Message` associated with an AMQP Message is acknowledged, it informs the broker that the message has been _accepted_.

You can also pass any property supported by the https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-amqp-client/java/[Vert.x AMQP client] as attribute.
