== Receiving messages from AMQP

The AMQP connector lets you retrieve messages from an https://www.amqp.org/product/architecture[AMQP broker or router].
The AMQP connector retrieves _AMQP Messages_ and maps each of them into Reactive Messaging `Messages`.

=== Example

Let's imagine you have an AMQP broker (such as https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/[Apache ActiveMQ Artemis]) running, and accessible using the `amqp:5672` address (by default it would use `localhost:5672`).
Configure your application to receive AMQP Messages on the `prices` channel as follows:

[source]
----
amqp-host=amqp               # <1>
amqp-port=5672               # <2>
amqp-username=my-username    # <3>
amqp-password=my-password    # <4>

mp.messaging.incoming.prices.connector=smallrye-amqp  # <5>
----
1. Configures the broker/router host name. You can do it per channel (using the `host` attribute) or globally using `amqp-host`
2. Configures the broker/router port. You can do it per channel (using the `port` attribute) or globally using `amqp-port`. The default is `5672`.
3. Configures the broker/router username if required. You can do it per channel (using the `username` attribute) or globally using `amqp-username`.
4. Configures the broker/router password if required. You can do it per channel (using the `password` attribute) or globally using `amqp-password`.
5. Instructs the `prices` channel to be managed by the AMQP connector

NOTE: You don't need to set the AMQP _address_. By default, it uses the channel name (`prices`). You can configure the `address` attribute to override it.

Then, your application receives `Message<Double>`.
You can consumes the payload directly:

[source, java]
----
include::example$inbound/AmqpPriceConsumer.java[]
----

Or, you can retrieve the `Message<Double>`:

[source, java]
----
include::example$inbound/AmqpPriceMessageConsumer.java[]
----

=== Deserialization

The connector converts incoming AMQP Messages into Reactive Messaging `Message<T>` instances.
`T` depends on the _body_ of the received AMQP Message.

The http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-types-v1.0-os.html[AMQP Type System] defines the supported types.

[options="header"]
|===
| AMQP Body Type | `<T>`
| AMQP Value containing a http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-types-v1.0-os.html#section-primitive-type-definitions[AMQP Primitive Type] | the corresponding Java type
| AMQP Value using the `Binary` type | `byte[]`
| AMQP Sequence | `List`
| AMQP Data (with binary content) and the `content-type` is set to `application/json` | https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/core/json/JsonObject.html[`JsonObject`]
| AMQP Data with a different `content-type` | `byte[]`
|===

If you send objects with this AMQP connector (outbound connector), it gets encoded as JSON and sent as binary.
The `content-type` is set to `application/json`.
You can receive this payload using (Vert.x) JSON Objects, and then map it to the object class you want:

[source, java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public static class Generator {

    @Outgoing("to-amqp")
    public Multi<Price> prices() { // <1>
        AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger();
        return Multi.createFrom().ticks().every(Duration.ofMillis(1000))
                .map(l -> new Price().setPrice(count.incrementAndGet()))
                .onOverflow().drop();
    }

}

@ApplicationScoped
public static class Consumer {

    List<Price> prices = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();

    @Incoming("from-amqp")
    public void consume(JsonObject p) {   // <2>
        Price price = p.mapTo(Price.class);  // <3>
        prices.add(price);
    }

    public List<Price> list() {
        return prices;
    }
}
----
1. The `Price` instances are automatically encoded to JSON by the connector
2. You can receive it using a `JsonObject`
3. Then, you can reconstruct the instance using the `mapTo` method

=== Inbound Metadata

Messages coming from AMQP contains an instance of {javadoc-base}/io/smallrye/reactive/messaging/amqp/IncomingAmqpMetadata.html[`IncomingAmqpMetadata`] in the metadata.

[source, java]
----
include::example$inbound/AmqpMetadataExample.java[]
----

=== Acknowledgement

When a Reactive Messaging `Message` associated with an AMQP Message is acknowledged, it informs the broker that the message has been _accepted_.

=== Failure Management

If a message produced from an AMQP message is _nacked_, a failure strategy is applied.
The AMQP connector supports six strategies:

* `fail` - fail the application; no more AMQP messages will be processed (default).
The AMQP message is marked as rejected.
* `accept` - this strategy marks the AMQP message as _accepted_. The processing continues ignoring the failure.
Refer to the http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-accepted[accepted delivery state documentation].
* `release` - this strategy marks the AMQP message as _released_. The processing continues with the next message. The broker can redeliver the message.
Refer to the http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-released[released delivery state documentation].
* `reject` - this strategy marks the AMQP message as rejected. The processing continues with the next message.
Refer to the http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-rejected[rejected delivery state documentation].
* `modified-failed` - this strategy marks the AMQP
message as _modified_ and indicates that it failed (with the `delivery-failed` attribute). The processing continues with the next message, but the broker may attempt to redeliver the message.
Refer to the http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-modified[modified delivery state documentation]
* `modified-failed-undeliverable-here` - this strategy marks the AMQP message as _modified_ and indicates that it failed (with the `delivery-failed` attribute). It also indicates that the application cannot process the message, meaning that the broker will not attempt to redeliver the message to this node. The processing continues with the next message.
Refer to the http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-modified[modified delivery state documentation]



=== Configuration Reference

include::connectors:partial$META-INF/connector/smallrye-amqp-incoming.adoc[]

You can also pass any property supported by the https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-amqp-client/java/[Vert.x AMQP client] as attribute.

To use an existing _address_ or _queue_, you need to configure the `address`, `container-id` and, optionally, the `link-name` attributes.
For example, if you have an Apache Artemis broker configured with:

[source, xml]
----
<queues>
    <queue name="people">
        <address>people</address>
        <durable>true</durable>
        <user>artemis</user>
    </queue>
</queues>
----

You need the following configuration:

[source, properties]
----
mp.messaging.incoming.people.connector=smallrye-amqp
mp.messaging.incoming.people.durable=true
mp.messaging.incoming.people.address=people
mp.messaging.incoming.people.container-id=people
----

You may need to configure the `link-name` attribute, if the queue name is not the channel name:

[source, properties]
----
mp.messaging.incoming.people-in.connector=smallrye-amqp
mp.messaging.incoming.people-in.durable=true
mp.messaging.incoming.people-in.address=people
mp.messaging.incoming.people-in.container-id=people
mp.messaging.incoming.people-in.link-name=people
----
