== Sending messages to AMQP

The AMQP connector can write Reactive Messaging `Messages` as AMQP Messages.

=== Example

Let's imagine you have an AMQP broker (such as https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/[Apache ActiveMQ Artemis]) running, and accessible using the `amqp:5672` address (by default it would use `localhost:5672`).
Configure your application to send the messages from the `prices` channel as AMQP Message as follows:

[source]
----
amqp-host=amqp               # <1>
amqp-port=5672               # <2>
amqp-username=my-username    # <3>
amqp-password=my-password    # <4>

mp.messaging.outgoing.prices.connector=smallrye-amqp       # <5>
----
1. Configures the broker/router host name. You can do it per channel (using the `host` attribute) or globally using `amqp-host`
2. Configures the broker/router port. You can do it per channel (using the `port` attribute) or globally using `amqp-port`. The default is `5672`.
3. Configures the broker/router username if required. You can do it per channel (using the `username` attribute) or globally using `amqp-username`.
4. Configures the broker/router password if required. You can do it per channel (using the `password` attribute) or globally using `amqp-password`.
5. Instructs the `prices` channel to be managed by the AMQP connector

NOTE: You don't need to set the _address_. By default, it uses the channel name (`prices`). You can configure the `address` attribute to override it.

Then, your application must send `Message<Double>` to the `prices` channel.
It can use `double` payloads as in the following snippet:

[source, java]
----
include::example$outbound/AmqpPriceProducer.java[]
----

Or, you can send `Message<Double>`:

[source, java]
----
include::example$outbound/AmqpPriceMessageProducer.java[]
----

=== Serialization

When receiving a `Message<T>`, the connector convert the message into an AMQP Message.
The payload is converted to the AMQP Message _body_.

[options=header]
|===
| `T` | AMQP Message Body
| primitive types or `String` | AMQP Value with the payload
| `Instant` or `UUID` | AMQP Value using the corresponding AMQP Type
| https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/core/json/JsonObject.html[`JsonObject`] or https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/core/json/JsonArray.html[`JsonArray`] | AMQP Data using a binary content. The `content-type` is set to `application/json`
| `io.vertx.mutiny.core.buffer.Buffer` | AMQP Data using a binary content. No `content-type` set
| Any other class | The payload is converted to JSON (using a Json Mapper). The result is wrapped into AMQP Data using a binary content. The `content-type` is set to `application/json`
|===

=== Outbound Metadata

When sending `Messages`, you can add an instance of {javadoc-base}/apidocs/io/smallrye/reactive/messaging/amqp/OutgoingAmqpMetadata.html[`OutgoingAmqpMetadata`] to influence how the message is going to sent to AMQP.
For example, you can configure the address, subjects, properties:

[source, java]
----
include::example$outbound/AmqpOutboundMetadataExample.java[tag=code]
----

NOTE: To be able to override the address per message, the connector is using an _anonymous sender_.

=== Acknowledgement

By default, the Reactive Messaging `Message` is acknowledged when the broker acknowledged the message.
When using routers, this acknowledgement may not be enabled.
In this case, configure the `auto-acknowledgement` attribute to acknowledge the message as soon as it has been sent to the router.

You can also pass any property supported by the https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-amqp-client/java/[Vert.x AMQP client] as attribute.
