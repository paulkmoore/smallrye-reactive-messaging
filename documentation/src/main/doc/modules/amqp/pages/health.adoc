== Health reporting

The AMQP connector reports the readiness and liveness of each channel managed by the connector.
The AMQP connector uses the same logic for the readiness and liveness checks.

NOTE: To disable health reporting, set the `health-enabled` attribute for the channel to `false`.

On the inbound side (receiving messages from AMQP), the check verifies that the receiver is attached to the broker.
On the outbound side (sending records to AMQP), the check verifies that the sender is attached to the broker.

Note that a message processing failures _nacks_ the message, which is then handled by the failure-strategy.
It the responsibility of the failure-strategy to report the failure and influence the outcome of the checks.
The `fail` failure strategy reports the failure, and so the check will report the fault.
