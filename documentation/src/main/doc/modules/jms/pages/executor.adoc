== Advanced configuration

=== Underlying thread pool

Lots of JMS operations are blocking and so not cannot be done on the _caller_ thread.
For this reason, these blocking operations are executed on a worker thread.

You can configure the thread pool providing these worker threads using the following MicroProfile Config properties:

* `smallrye.jms.threads.max-pool-size` - the max number of threads (Defaults to 10)
* `smallrye.jms.threads.ttl`  - the ttl of the created threads (Defaults to 60 seconds)

=== Selecting the ConnectionFactory

The JMS Connector requires a `javax.jms.ConnectionFactory` to be exposed (as CDI bean).
The connector looks for a `javax.jms.ConnectionFactory` and delegate the interaction with the JMS server to this factory.

In case you have several connection factories, you can use the `@Named` qualifier on your factory to specify the name.
Then, in the channel configuration, configure the name as follows:

[source,properties]
----
# Configure the connector globally
mp.messaging.connector.smallrye-jms.connection-factory-name=my-factory-name
# Configure a specific incoming channel
mp.messaging.incoming.my-channel.connection-factory-name=my-factory-name
# Configure a specific outgoing channel
mp.messaging.outgoing.my-channel.connection-factory-name=my-factory-name
----
